Hello, This is progject MVP(Most Valuable Player). This program will list the five most recent MVps of the National Basketball Association. The user will be able to view, add and delete players as the user sees fit. The user will need to install the Newtonsoft Json package if the user does not already have this extension installed in their version of Visual Studio. Have fun and enjoy.
